# Carnot Engine
Game engine prototype. Written in C++ with SFML and OpenGL.

Works very bad yet.

## How to run it?
>build source in visual studio
>move Carnot Engine.exe from DEBUG folder to RTX folder
>run Carnot Engine.exe
>paste path to save file 
>paste save file name
>exit with alt+f4

##Why main folder is called rtx?
i wanted to write opengl ray tracing project, but then something went wrong

## To-do list:
- [ ] finish engine GUI
- [ ] in-game UI
- [ ] improve scripting 
- [ ] Demo scene
- [ ] animations
