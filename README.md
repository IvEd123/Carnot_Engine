# Carnot Engine
Game engine prototype. Written in C++ with SFML and OpenGL.

Works very bad yet.

## How to run it?
1) build source in visual studio
2) move Carnot Engine.exe from DEBUG folder to RTX folder
3) run Carnot Engine.exe
4) paste path to save file 
5) paste save file name
6) exit with alt+f4

##Why main folder is called rtx?
i wanted to write opengl ray tracing project, but then something went wrong

## To-do list:
- [ ] finish engine GUI
- [ ] in-game UI
- [ ] improve scripting 
- [ ] Demo scene
- [ ] animations
